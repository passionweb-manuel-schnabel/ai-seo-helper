    # cat=basic request settings; type=string; label=OpenAI Model
    openAiModel = gpt-3.5-turbo

The id of the model which will generate the completion. See `models overview <https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview/gpt-3-5>`_ for an overview of available models.

.. code-block:: none

    # cat=basic request settings; type=double+; label=OpenAI Temperature
    openAiTemperature = 0.5

What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.

    # cat=basic request settings; type=int+; label=OpenAI Top-P
    openAiTopP = 1

    # cat=basic request settings; type=double; label=OpenAI Frequency Penalty
    openAiFrequencyPenalty = 0.8

    # cat=basic request settings; type=boolean; label=Use always URL for requests
    useUrlForRequest = 1

With this option you can use the corresponding URL of the page for all analyses. As a result, you have to use fewer tokens to carry out your corresponding analyses. IMPORTANT: The page must be publicly accessible (hidden pages fail and pages in a local environment lead to poor results)
